# Lab Assistant Front End
## Description
I work as a Research Associate in a lab for a biotech company and I make use of many chemistry calculations in my career. It was becoming difficult to keep track of all the formulas I use so I decided to make this website where they are all in once place and easily accessible. Since its creation, this website has aided me and a number of colleagues in generating real data that has been presented to customers in a faster and more efficient way. <br>
This repository is for the front-end of the website which is built with React.js, TailwindCSS, and MaterialUI. 

## Usage
This site allows a user to make an account which allows them to favorite specific calculations to a side-bar for easy access. However, a user isn't required to create an account and can still browse and use all the calculations. To use the calculations, just navigate to the calculations tab, choose a calculation, and follow the instructions on the page on the correct way to use it.

## Deployed Site
You can access this website here at this link: https://lab-assistant1.herokuapp.com/
<br>
<br>
The backend is a Java Springboot REST API that communicates with a MySQL database to store users and their favorited calculations.<br>
You can find the repository for the backend at this link: https://github.com/Sam-Clark1/lab-assistant-api
