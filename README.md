# Lab Assistant Front End
## Description
I work as a Research Associate in a lab for a biotech company and I am doing calculations everyday. It was becoming difficult to keep track of all the formulas I use so I decided to make this website where they are all in once place and easily accessible. This repository is for the front-end of the website which is built with React.js, TailwindCSS, and MaterialUI.
